# PROJECT PROPOSAL 

**Team Members:** Mehria Sadaat Khan, Jasnoor Anand, Sanaa Kashif

## Motivating Question

Our assignment will be a cross country comparison between Jordan, Iraq and Syria looking at the life of refugees between these countries. More concretely, our research question is:
*How have hosting policies and conflict intensity shaped refugee education prospects or gender gaps across host countries over time?*

## Data Source

We will be using open access data from the UNHRC. These three countries have yearly population data sets from 1964-2024.\

## Description of the approach 

We will use the refugees R package to pull the UNHCR population dataset and filter it to Middle East countries of asylum.

From there we will construct a panel dataset that aggregates, by country year, the number of refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs and stateless persons, and basic demographic breakdowns (for example school age versus non school age, gender).

Using this, we will produce an initial "diagnostic" of the region with summary tables and time series plots that compare how refugee loads have evolved across Middle East host countries.

This will then be merged with simple host-country characteristics from other public APIs (for example education and income indicators from the World Bank) to capture the education and fiscal environment in which refugees are hosted. Geospatial analysis will then be used (maps of refugee load per capita by host country) and an unsupervised learning method (for example k-means clustering) to identify groups of countries that follow similar hosting patterns and capacity profiles.

We will use these empirical patterns to discuss what they imply for burden sharing and where education-focused interventions for refugees might be most urgent.

## Hurdles 

1\. We don't have a direct variable to determine 'good hosting policy'. We will have to use other variables and create a sort of index to standardise how well countries have adapted to refugees. The issue lies in determining what is a 'good' policy and what a 'bad' policy is and quantifying that.

2. Scope of coverage with our data.

3. Finding additional data to merge with our initial data set. Since our UNHCR data set is so exhaustive, we may have an issue in finding a secondary data set that matches our time frame.
